Product Backlog
List all the product backlog here or link here
All the backlog items should have (a) epic/requirements, (b) who is going to do it, (c) deadline, and (d) tests; also, each item should have an id to trace.
Even though the product backlog can be found in the project management tool, the team should make the backlog information easily accessible from the Canvas page (directly or using online documentation tools such as GitHub or Google Docs).
The product backlog can be modified or updated, so in this case, it's a good idea to upload them in GitHub and trace the change.
